<h1>Nau mai ki Tātai</h1>
<p>Tātai is a place where Māori can share<br>iwi affiliations, with iwi, and the Ministry<br>of Health, to make a positive difference<br>today, and for future generations. It is a<br>data collection tool that will provide iwi<br>with much better health information.</p>
<p>Sharing your iwi affiliations is a way to<br> ensure we, as Māori, are contributing to<br> worthwhile and high-quality datasets<br> about iwi, for iwi. Tātai has been<br> created in partnership with Māori, for<br> Māori.</p>

<h1>Benefits</h1>
<h2>Strengthen Datasets about Māori</h2>
<p>This is an opportunity to contribute your iwi information to a dataset about the population and growth of your iwi.</p>
<p>With the collection of this data iwi can use the information as a tool to understand iwi population status and better understand where Māori, iwi, hapū and whānau live, so that the delivery of resources and services can be coordinated more easily and Māori have access to services faster and more efficiently.</p>
<h2>Iwi Resourcing</h2>
<p>We know that there is a greater need to ensure that iwi are adequately resourced to provide greater opportunities for what Māori can be empowered to do and how iwi can be better supported.</p>
<p>Collecting and updating iwi affiliation data will enable iwi to have more quality data to plan where to put resources and develop programmes, services and interventions by Māori, for Māori.</p>
<h2>Future Outcomes</h2>
<p>Contributing to this kaupapa gives your iwi better information to plan ahead and it will help Māori have the autonomy to implement initiatives, processes, and address areas of need & concern as defined, and as witnessed by iwi.</p>
<p>It is a way to raise the levels of equity and development for our people, and address areas of need.</p>
