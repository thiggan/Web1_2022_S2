## Ara Wines website - Website Project 

# Project Description
This is a project to look at a website, look at how it is constructed and replicate this myself. I will need to inspect the original website to see how things are done but I will be using my own code to build it with the help of more research online looking at some of the more complicated parts.
I will search for images to use and credit these where applicable these will not be the same as the original website though. Use fonts the same or as close as I can get to make it look the same. The website will have the same features as the original. 
I will be using HTML, Javascript and CSS to create this website. I have used a variety of styles, and a carousel with images fetched using API data. These each contain three images and they change every 1.5 seconds. 
Some features used:
### 1. Modal with links and a close button on
### 2. Fixed socaial bar on the left-side
### 3. Two different carousels
### 4. A page that will resize and is responsive
### 5. Flex and Grid structures


# Contents
 ## 1. Home page
 ### 1.1 Information about the Marlborough Region
 ### 1.2 Information about the wines the make
 ### 1.3 Information about the quality of the wine
 ### 1.4 The Climate of the region
 ### 1.5 Latest Wines

 ## How to use this website
This site is designed to give the user more information about the wines produced. Once this has loaded the website should run and you will be able to browse it. There are links to navigate to other areas within the site most of these will have a pointer cursor on them. Navigation is easy around the site.
