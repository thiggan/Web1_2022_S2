# Title
## Ara Wines website - Website Project 

# Project Description
This is a project to look at a website, look at how it is constructed and replicate this myself. I will need to inspect the original website to see how things are done but I will be using my own code to build it.
I will search for images to use and credit these where applicable these will not be the same as the original website though. Use fonts the same or as close as I can get to make it look the same. The website will have the same features as the original. 
I will be using HTML, Javascript and CSS to create this website.
